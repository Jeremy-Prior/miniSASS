    1. **Form Fields:** The Contact Form includes the following fields:

        - **Your Name:** Enter your full name in the `Your Name` field. This helps personalise your message and allows the recipient to address you appropriately.

        - **Your Email:** Provide your email address in the `Your Email` field. This is essential for receiving responses and keeping you informed about your inquiry.

        - **Phone Number:** Enter your phone number in the `Phone Number` field if applicable. This helps in contacting you.

        - **Your Message:** Type your message or inquiry in the `Your Message` field. Be clear and concise in expressing your thoughts or questions.

        *Initially, the `Submit` button is non-clickable. It remains disabled until all the required fields (Your Name, Your Email, and Your Message) are filled. As you fill in the required fields, the `Submit` button becomes clickable. This indicates that you have provided the necessary information for submission.*
